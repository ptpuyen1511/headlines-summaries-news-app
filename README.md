# My Own News App
My Streamlit-based news application utilizes ElasticSearch for powerful search capabilities. Additionally, it might incorporate AI features in the future to enhance the user experience.

## Draft plan

- [x] Step 1: Crawl news (from <https://e.vnexpress.net/>) $\to$ summarize
- [x] Step 2: Build a database with
    - Local: SQLite
    - Cloud: PostgreSQL or ElasticSearch (chose PostgreSQL on Neon)
- [ ] Step 3: Code app using Streamlit
- [ ] Step 4: Add some AI-powered features:
